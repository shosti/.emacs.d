;;; Code:

;;; These belong in prog-mode-hook:

;; We have a number of turn-on-* functions since it's advised that lambda
;; functions not go in hooks. Repeatedly evaling an add-to-list with a
;; hook value will repeatedly add it since there's no way to ensure
;; that a byte-compiled lambda doesn't already exist in the list.
