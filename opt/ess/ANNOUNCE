1 ANNOUNCING ESS
****************

The ESS Developers proudly announce the release of ESS

   13.05

   Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides an intelligent, consistent
interface between the user and the software.  ESS interfaces with
R/S-PLUS, SAS, BUGS/JAGS, Stata and other statistical analysis packages
under the UNIX, GNU Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and other
operating systems.  ESS is a package for the GNU Emacs and XEmacs text
editors whose features ESS uses to streamline the creation and use of
statistical software.  ESS knows the syntax and grammar of statistical
analysis packages and provides consistent display and editing features
based on that knowledge.  ESS assists in interactive and batch
execution of statements written in these statistical analysis languages.

   ESS is freely available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please read the file COPYING which comes with the distribution, for
more information about the license. For more detailed information,
please read the README files that come with ESS.

1.1 Getting the Latest Version
==============================

The latest released version of ESS is always available on the web at:
ESS web page (http://ess.r-project.org) or StatLib
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/)

1.1.1 ESS subversion repository
-------------------------------

The latest development version of ESS is available via
`https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/', the ESS Subversion repository.  If
you have a Subversion client (see `http://subversion.tigris.org/'), you
can download the sources using:
     % svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk PATH
   which will put the ESS files into directory PATH.  Later, within
that directory, `svn update' will bring that directory up to date.
Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: ESS SVN site (https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk).
However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the load
when retrieving.

   If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you
can then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

     (load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el")

   Note that https is required, and that the SSL certificate for the
Subversion server of the R project is

     Certificate information:
      - Hostname: svn.r-project.org
      - Valid: from Jul 16 08:10:01 2004 GMT until Jul 14 08:10:01 2014 GMT
      - Issuer: Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, CH
      - Fingerprint: c9:5d:eb:f9:f2:56:d1:04:ba:44:61:f8:64:6b:d9:33:3f:93:6e:ad

(currently, there is no "trusted certificate").  You can accept this
certificate permanently and will not be asked about it anymore.

1.1.2 Git for development

1.3 Requirements
================

ESS is most likely to work with current/recent versions of the following
statistical packages: R/S-PLUS, SAS, Stata, OpenBUGS and JAGS.

   ESS supports current, and recent, stable versions of GNU Emacs
(currently, specifically, the 23.x and 24.x series;
alpha/beta/pre-release versions are NOT SUPPORTED).  Due to XEmacs
lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS support of XEmacs ends
with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision will be re-visited in the future as
XEmacs continues to sync with GNU Emacs.

   To build the PDF documentation, you will need a version of TeX Live
or texinfo that includes texi2dvi (BEWARE: recent TeX Live, and some
texinfo RPMs, do NOT include texi2dvi).

1.4 Stability
=============

All recent released versions are meant to be release-quality versions.
While some new features are being introduced, we are cleaning up and
improving the interface.  We know that there are many remaining
opportunities for documentation improvements, but all contributors are
volunteers and time is precious. Patches or suggested fixes with bug
reports are much appreciated!

1.5 Mailing List
================

There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help" (or
"help") in the body to <ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to
<ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch>.  Rest assured, this is a fairly
low-volume mailing list.

   The purposes of the mailing list include

   *  helping users of ESS to get along with it.

   *  discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs.

   *  suggestions for improvements.

   *  announcements of new releases of ESS.

   *  posting small patches to ESS.

1.6 Reporting Bugs
==================

Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to
<ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch>

   The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   `M-x ess-submit-bug-report'

   This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   If Emacs reports an error, backtraces can help us debug the problem.
Type "M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET".  Then run the
command that causes the error and you should see a *Backtrace* buffer
containing debug information; send us that buffer.

   Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

1.9 New Features
================

Changes/New Features in 13.05:
   * ESS[gretl]: Support for `gretl' (both editing and sub-process
     interaction). A contribution of Ahmadou Dicko.

   * ESS: process output display is 4-10 times faster due to new caching
     and only occasional emacs re-display (for the moment this
     functionality is available only when `ess-tracebug' is active).

   * ESS: `C-c `' is now bound to `ess-show-traceback' and `C-c ~' is
     bound to `ess-show-call-stack'.

   * ESS[R]: ESS stores function in 'ESSR' environment to avoid
     kludging users' global environment and accidental deletion.

   * ESS[R]: new variable `ess-swv-processing-command' to control
     weaving and tangling.

   * ESS[R]: `ess-default-style' has been changed  (from `DEFAULT') to
     `RRR'.  Use something like  `(setq ess-default-style 'DEFAULT)' or
     `(setq ess-indent-level 2)' in your `~/.emacs' equivalent
     _before_ loading ESS, if you do not like this new "incompatible"
     default style.

   * ESS[julia]: ESS stores its functions in 'ESS' module.

   * ESS[julia]: Eldoc is now supported in julia modes

   * ESS[julia]: Adjusted error reference detection and interactive help
     to julia internal changes

   * ESS[R]: `ess-use-tracebug''s default has been changed to  `t'. Set
     it to nil if you want to keep the previous behavior.

   * ESS[tracebug]: Electric debug keys have been removed [breaking
     change] The functionality was replaced with `ess-debug-minor-mode'
     and `ess-debug-minor-mode-map'.

   * ESS[tracebug]: `ess-tracebug-map' is an alias to  `ess-dev-map'
     `C-c C-t'.

   * ESS[tracebug]: `ess-bp-toggle-state' (`C-c C-t o')  can now be
     used during the debug session to toggle breakpoints on the fly
     (suggestion by Ross Boylan).

   * ESS[tracebug]: `ess-debug-flag-for-debugging' and
     `ess-debug-unflag-for-debugging' work correctly from the debugging
     contexts. These commands also recognize non-exported functions for
     the  packages listed in `ess-developer-packages' (`C-c C-t C-a').

   * ESS[R]: Eldoc (activated by `ess-use-eldoc') has  become more
     sophisticated, and hence also more intruding in the interface
     between the Statistics softare, e.g., R, and the user.

     Note that you can turn off ElDoc, by placing `(setq ess-use-eldoc
     nil)'  in your `~/.emacs' file, prior to loading ESS,

   * ESS[SAS]: long over-looked `SAS-mode-hook' appears!

   * ESS[SAS]: `ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle' now defaults to `t' since
     `sas-indent-line' is still broken, i.e. `TAB' is now bound to
     `ess-sas-tab-to-tab-stop' by default

   Changes/Bug Fixes in 12.09-2:
   * ESS: new `ess-switch-to-end-of-proc-buffer' variable that controls
     whether `C-c C-z' switches to the end of process buffer. The
     default is `t'. You can use prefix argument to `C-c C-z' to
     toggle this variable.

   * ESS: fix in `ess-eval-linewise' that was causing emacs to hang
     during R debugging with `ess-eval-visibly' equal to `t'.

   * ESS: fix in `ess-eval-linewise' that was causing emacs to recenter
     the prompt in visible window

   * ESS[tracebug]: A better handling of "Selection" prompts and debug
     related singlekey commands.

   * ESS: fix a bug in `ess-switch-process' that was causing `*new*'
     selection to fail.

   * ESS[R]: Solve missing `ess-local-process-name' bug in R-dired.

   * ESS[SWV]: `ess-swv-PDF' doesn't ask for a command to run if there
     is only one command in `ess-swv-pdflatex-commands'.

   * ESS[SWV]: `ess-swv-weave' gained an universal argument to allow
     for an interactive choice between available weavers (sweave,
     knitr).

   * ESS: `ess-eval-*-and-step' functions go to next empty line at eob,
     instead of staying at the last line.

   Changes/New Features in 12.09-1:
   * ESS _Breaking Changes in Keys_:

        - New keymaps: `ess-doc-map' bound to `C-c C-d';
          `ess-extra-map' bound to `C-c C-e';
          `ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' was moved on `C-c C-e C-d'

        - roxygen map was moved on `C-c C-o' and
          `ess-roxy-update-entry' now resides on `C-c C-o C-o'

        - ess-handy-commands is not bound anymore

        - `ess-dev-map' (including `ess-tracebug' and `ess-developer')
          moved on `C-c C-t'

        - `C-c C-y' is deprecated in favor of `C-c C-z C-z'

   * ESS[R] new command `ess-describe-object-at-point' bound to `C-c
     C-d C-e' (repeat `C-e' or `e' to cycle). It was inspired by Erik
     Iverson's `ess-R-object-tooltip'. Customize
     `ess-describe-at-point-method' to use tooltip instead of an
     electric buffer.

   * ESS: New command `ess-build-tags-for-directory' bound to `C-c C-e
     C-t' for building dialect specific tag tables. After building tags
     use `M-.' to navigate to function and objects definitions. By
     default `C-c C-e C-t' builds tags based on imenu regular
     expressions and also include other common languages `.c, .o, .cpp'
     etc. But it relies on external `find' and `etags' commands. If
     `ess-build-tags-command' is defined (for `R'), the inferior
     process is asked to build tags instead.

   * ESS: `ess-switch-process' offers `*new*' alternative to start a
     new process instead of switching to one of the currently running
     processes.

   * ESS: Switching between processes (`C-c C-s') uses buffer names
     instead of the internal process names. Use `M-x rename-buffer'
     command to conveniently rename your process buffers.

   * ESS: Process buffers can be automatically named on process creation
     according to user specified scheme. Default schemes are *proc*,
     *proc:dir* and *proc:abbr-long-dir* where `proc' stands for the
     internal process name and `dir' stands for the directory where the
     process was started in. The default is *proc*. For customization
     see `ess-gen-proc-buffer-name-function'.

   * ESS: `ess-eval-visibly-p' is deprecated in favor of
     `ess-eval-visibly'.

   * ESS: New evaluation pattern `nowait'.  In addition to old `nil'
     and `t' values, `ess-eval-visibly' accepts `nowait' for a visible
     evaluation with no waiting for the process. See `ess-eval-visibly'
     for details on evaluation patterns.

   * ESS: New "Process" menu entry with process related commands and
     configuration

   * iESS: Process buffer is now automatically shown on errors

   * ESS: New `ess-switch-to-inferior-or-script-buffer' command bound
     to `C-c C-z' in both script and process buffers. If invoked form
     process buffer it switches to the most recent buffer of the same
     dialect. It is a single key command.

   * ESSR-help:  On multiple help pages with the same name, `C-c C-v'
     now asks for user resolution directly in emacs.

   * ESS[R] ess-roxy: new variable `ess-roxy-re' for fontification of
     cases where the number of leading `#' differs from `ess-roxy-str'.

   * ESS[R] Eldoc was considerably enhanced.  It now finds hidden
     default S3 methods and displays non-default methods' arguments
     after trailing ||.

   * ESS[R]: New `ess-display-demos' command bound to `C-c C-d o' and
     `C-c C-d C-o'

   * ESS: New `ess-help-web-search' command bound to `C-c C-d w' and
     `C-c C-d C-w' to facilitate interactive search of web resources.
     Implemented for `R', `Stata' and `Julia'. See also
     `ess-help-web-search-command'.

   * ESS: ess-pdf-viewer-pref accepts now command line arguments

   * ESS[Rnw]: Add knitr support.  Customize `ess-swv-processor' for
     the default processor.

   * ESS[Rnw]: More thorough renaming of remaining `noweb-*' to
     `ess-noweb-*'.

   * ESS[Rnw] new commands `ess-eval-chunk-and-step' and
     `ess-eval-chunk' bound to `M-n C-c' and `M-n C-M-x' to mirror
     standard ess commands in C-c map.

   * ESS[R] Auto-completion: new variable `ess-ac-R-argument-suffix' to
     customize the insertion of trailing "=". Defaults to " = ".

   * ESS[Julia]: Added index, apropos and web-search to julia.

   * ESS help: More evaluation commands were added to ess-help mode
     (`C-c C-c', `C-M-x' etc)

   Bug Fixes in 12.09-1:
   * iESShelp: Multiple help pages with the same name are properly
     handled on `C-c C-v'

   * iESSremote: Evaluation with ESS remote no longer freezes emacs.

   * iESS: `comint-previous-prompt' `C-c C-p' no longer stops on
     secondary prompt "+".

   * iESS[R], iESS(Sqpe) [S] on Windows: The `options("editor")' is now
     initialized to `emacsclient' instead of the previous `gnuclient'.
     The user may need to add the line `(server-start)' to the emacs
     initialization file. `emacsclient' has been included with emacs
     since GNU Emacs 22.1.

   * ESS[Rnw] Fixed "connection to R" bug (in 12.09 only).

   * ESS[Rnw] Explicit `ess-swv-stangle' and `ess-swv-sweave' functions.

   * ESS[Rnw] Fixed completion and smart underscore problems cause by
     unmatched "\"'

   * ESS[R] is more careful with the `R' code injection.  It now
     happens only once at the start of the session.

   * ESS[R]: Fixed auto-scrolling the comint buffer on evaluation.

   * ESS[Julia]: Solve several indentation and word navigation problems.

   * ESS[Julia]: Help system works again.

   Changes/New Features in 12.09:

   * Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS support
     of XEmacs ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision will be re-visited
     in the future as XEmacs continues to sync with GNU Emacs.

   * ESS[R]: On Windows, there is now a new customizable variable
     (currently called `ess-directory-containing-R') to tell ESS where
     to look for the `Rterm.exe' executables.  The name of the variable
     and the values it can take are both in beta and subject to change.
     Prior to this variable, ESS searched only in the default
     installation directory.  Setting this variable now tells ESS how
     to find `Rterm.exe' executables when they are installed somewhere
     else.

   * ESS[julia]: _new_ mode for editing julia code (`*.jl'). Start with
     `M-x julia'.

     Full interaction interface, imenu and basic error referencing are
     available.

   * ESS[R] noweb: `noweb-mode' and `noweb-font-lock-mode' have been
     renamed to `ess-noweb-mode' and `ess-noweb-font-lock-mode' to
     avoid conflicts with the "real" `noweb-mode'.

   * ESS[R] noweb: The long standing font-lock bug has been solved in
     `ess-noweb' interface.

   * ESS: Basic evaluation keys are now bound to `ess-eval-region-*-'
     functions:

        - `C-M-x' is bound to `ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph'

        - `C-c C-c' is bound to
          `ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph-and-step'

        - `C-RET' is bound to `ess-eval-region-or-line-and-step'

     Each of these functions first evaluates the region whenever the
     region is active.

   * ESS: `C-M-a'/`C-M-e' now step to beginning/end of paragraph if no
     function has been detected.

   * ESS: `ess-eval-*-and-step' family of functions are now smarter,
     and don't step to end of buffer or end of chunk code (`@') when at
     the end of the code.

   * ESS: `ess-handy-commands' function is bound to `C-c h'

   * ESS: ESS is now _blinking_  the evaluated region.  Set
     `ess-blink-region' to nil to deactivate; `ess-blink-delay' gives
     the duration of the blink. Evaluated region is "blinked" in
     `highlight' face.

   * ESS[R-help]  New key `a' for "apropos()" in help buffers. Also
     available through `C-c h'.

   * ESS[R-help]  All R commands of type foo?bar and foo??bar are
     recognized and redirected into appropriate *ESS-help* buffers.

   * ESS[R]: New customization interface for _font-lock_.

     ESS font-lock operates with predefined keywords. Default keywords
     are listed in `ess-R-font-lock-keywords' and
     `inferior-R-font-lock-keywords', which see. The user can easily
     customize those by adding new keywords. These variables can also be
     interactively accessed and saved through `ESS/Font-lock' submenu.

     Several new fontification keywords have been added. Most notably
     the keywords for highlighting of function calls, numbers and
     operators.

   * ESS[R]: auto-complete is now activated by default whenever
     auto-complete package is detected. Set `ess-use-auto-complete' to
     nil to deactivate.

   * ESS[R]: R AC sources are no longer auto-starting at 0 characters
     but at the default `ac-auto-start' characters.

   * ESS no longer redefines default ac-sources, but only appends
     `ac-source-filename' to it.

   * ESS: `ac-source-R' now concatenates " = " to function arguments.

   * ESS: Menus for ESS and iESS have been reorganized and enriched with
     _Tracebug_ and _Developer_ submenus.

   * ESS[R]: `ess-developer' and `ess-tracebug' commands are available
     by default in `ess-dev-map' which is bound to `C-c d' in ESS and
     iESS maps.

   * ESS[R]: `eldoc' truncates long lines whenever
     `eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' is non-nil (the default). Set
     this variable to t if you insist on multiline eldoc.  See also
     `ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style'.

   * ESS[R]: completion code pre-caches arguments of heavy generics
     such as `plot' and `print' to eliminated the undesirable delay on
     first request.

   * iESS: Prompts in inferior buffers are now highlighted uniformly
     with `comint-highlight-prompt' face.

   * ESS[R]: R process no longer wait for the completion of input in
     inferior buffer.  Thus, long running commands like `Sys.sleep(5)'
     no longer stall emacs.

   * ESS: [R, S, Stata, Julia] have specialized `ess-X-post-run-hook's,
     which are run at the end of subprocess initialization.

   * ESS[Stata]: All interactive evaluation commands work as expected.
     On-line comments are removed before the evaluation and multiline
     comments are skipped on `C-c C-c' and other interactive commands.

   * ESS no longer auto-connects to a subprocess with a different
     dialect than the current buffer's one.

   * ESS: `ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' is now a list for all the
     ESS indentation styles, which results in the following indentation
     after an open "(":

       a <- some.function(other.function(
          arg1,
          arg2)

   * ESS[SAS]: Improved MS RTF support for GNU Emacs; try
     `ess-sas-rtf-portrait' and `ess-sas-rtf-landscape'.

   Changes/Bug Fixes in 12.04-3:
   * ESS: basic support for package.el compatibility

   * ESS[R]: correct indentation of & and | continuation lines

   * `M-x ess-version' shows the svn revision even after `make install'

   * ESS[SAS]: improved XEmacs support

   * iESS[R]: better finding of previous prompt

   * ESS[Stata]: adjusted prompt for mata mode

   * ESS[R]: resolved name clashes with cl.el

   * ESS[R]: removed dependence on obsolete package assoc

   * New `make' target  `lisp', to build the lisp-only part, i.e., not
     building the docs.

   Changes/New Features in 12.04-1:
   * iESS[Stata]: New interactive help invocation.

   * iESS[Stata]: New custom variable `inferior-STA-start-file'.

   * iESS[Stata]: `inferior-STA-program-name' is now "stata" and can be
     customized.

   * ESS[Stata] New sections in stata help files Syntax(`s-S'),
     Remarks(`r'), Title(`t').

   Bug Fixes in 12.04-1:
   * ESS[R]: Better `ess-tracebug' error handling.

   * ESS[R]: Corrected `ess-eldoc' help string filtering and improved
     argument caching.

   * ESS[R]: Indentation of non-block if/else/for/while lines fixed.

   * `M-x ess-version' should work better.

   * ESS: Filename completion now again works inside strings.

   * iESS[Stata]: Fixed prompt detection issue.

   * ESS[Rd]: R is autostarted also from here, when needed.

   Changes/New Features in 12.04:
   * ESS: Reverting new behavior of 12.03, `TAB' in `ess-mode' no
     longer completes by default.  If you want smart `TAB' completion
     in R and S scripts, similarly to iESS behavior, set the variable
     `ess-tab-complete-in-script' to `t'. Also see
     `ess-first-tab-never-complete' for how to customize where first
     `TAB' is allowed to complete.

   * ESS: completion is consistently bound to `M-TAB' (aka `M-C-i') in
     both Emacs23 and Emacs24.

   * ESS: The variable `ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' introduced in
     ESS(12.03) now accepts a list with the first element a number to
     indicate that the offset should be computed from the indent of the
     previous line. For example setting it to '(2) results in:

       a <- some.function(
         arg1,
         arg2)


   Changes/New Features in 12.03:
   * ESS indentation: new offset variable
     `ess-arg-function-offset-new-line' controlling for the indentation
     of lines immediately following open '('. This is useful to shift
     backwards function arguments after a long function call expression:

       a <- some.function(
              arg1,
              arg2)

     instead of the old

       a <- some.function(
                          arg1,
                          arg2)

     If '(' is not followed by new line the behavior is unchanged:

       a <- some.function(arg1,
                          arg2)

     This variable should be set as part of indentation style lists, or
     in ess-mode hook.

   * ESS[R]: `C-c .' sets (indentation) style.

   * ESS: In ESS buffers `yank'(`C-y') command accepts  double argument
     `C-u C-u' to paste commands only. It deletes any lines not
     beginning with a prompt, and then removes the prompt from those
     lines that remain. Useful to paste code from emails,
     documentation, inferior ESS buffers or transcript files.

   * Documentation: ESS user manual has been rearranged and completed
     with several new chapters and sections to reflect newly added
     features ("Completion", "Developing with ESS", "ESS tracebug",
     "ESS developer", "ESS ElDoc", "IDO Completion" and "Evaluating
     Code")

   * RefCard: Reference card was updated to include new features.

   * Eldoc: Eldoc was rewritten and is activated by default.  See
     `ess-use-eldoc', `ess-eldoc-show-on-symbol',
     `ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style' variables for how to change the
     default behavior. _Note:_ `skeleton-pair-insert-maybe' prohibits
     eldoc display, on `(' insertion.

   * ESS[R]: Eldoc shows arguments of a generic function whenever found.

   * ESS: `TAB' in `ess-mode' now indents and completes, if there is
     nothing to indent. Set `ess-first-tab-never-completes-p' to `t' to
     make `TAB' never complete on first invocation. Completion
     mechanism is similar to the completion in the `inferior-ess-mode'
     - a filename expansion is tried, if not found ESS completes the
     symbol by querying the process.

   * ESS for emacs version 24 or higher: ESS is  fully compatible with
     the emacs 24 completion scheme, i.e. all the completion is done by
     `completion-at-point'. Also in accordance with emacs conventions,
     ESS doesn't bind `M-TAB' for emacs 24 or higher. `M-TAB' calls the
     default `complete-symbol'.

   * ESS[R]: Out of the box integration with `Auto Completion' mode
     (http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/). Three AC sources
     `ac-source-R-args', `ac-source-R-objects' and `ac-source-R' are
     provided. The last one combines the previous two and makes them
     play nicely together. Set `ess-use-auto-complete' to `t' to start
     using it.  Refer to documentation string of `ac-use-auto-complete'
     for further information.

   * ESS[R]: New unified and fast argument completion system, comprised
     of `ess-funname.start', `ess-function-arguments',
     `ess-get-object-at-point'. Eldoc and auto-completion integration
     are using this system.

   * ESS: `ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS'(`C-c C-z'), and
     `ess-switch-to-ESS'(`C-c C-y'): Automatically start the process
     whenever needed.

   * ESS[R]: `roxy' knows about previewing text version of the
     documentation. Bound to `C-c C-e t'.

   * ESS[R]: Solved the "nil filename" bug in roxygen support.

   * ESS[R]: `ess-tracebug' is now part of ESS:

     New Features:

        - Source injection: Tracebug now can inject source references
          on the fly during code evaluation, i.e. you don't have to
          source your file, but just evaluate your code in normal
          fashion. Variable `ess-tracebug-inject-source-p' controls
          this behavior - if t, always inject source reference, if
          `'function', inject only for functions (this is the default),
          if `nil', never inject.

          During the source injection the value of `ess-eval-visibly' is
          ignored.

        - Org-mode support: Visual debugger is now aware of the
          temporary org source editing buffer (`C-c '') and jumps
          through this buffers if still alive, or in original org
          buffer otherwise.

        - New keys in watch mode: `?' and `d'

        - Two new hooks: ess-tracebug-enter-hook and
          ess-tracebug-exit-hook

   * ESS[R]: New package `ess-developer' to evaluate `R' code directly
     in the package environment and namespace. It can be toggled on and
     off with `C-c d t'. When `ess-developer' is on all ESS evaluation
     commands are redefined to evaluate code in appropriate
     environments. Add package names to the list of your development
     packages with `C-d a', and remove with `C-d r'. Source the current
     file with `C-d s'.Evaluation function which depend on
     ``ess-eval-region'' ask for the package to source the code into,
     `ess-eval-function' and alternatives search for the function name
     in the development packages' environment and namespace and insert
     the definition accordingly. See the documentation section
     "Developing with ESS/ESS developer" for more details.

   * ESS[R] help system:

     New Features:

        - `q' quits window instead of calling
          `ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS'.  This is consistent with emacs
          behavior help and other special buffers (_breaking change_).

        - `k' kills window without asking for the name (pointed by Sam
          Steingold)

        - Help map inherits from `special-mode-map' as sugested by Sam
          Steingold.

        - Package index: new function `ess-display-index' bound to `i'
          in help mode map.

        - Package vignettes: new function `ess-display-vignettes' bound
          to `v' in help mode map.

        - Display help in HTML browser: new function
          `ess-display-help-in-browser' bound to `w' in help mode map.
          It depends on `R''s `browser' option.

        - New custom variable `ess-help-pop-to-buffer': if non-nil ESS
          help buffers are given focus on display. The default is `t'
          (_breaking change_).

        - New menu entries for the above functions.

        - Bogus help buffers are no longer generated by default, i.e.
          buffers of the form "No documentation for 'foo' in specified
          packages and libraries: you could try '??foo' ".
          `ess-help-kill-bogus-buffers' now defaults to `t'.  Beware,
          there may be instances where the default is unsatisfactory
          such as debugging and/or during R development.  Thanks to
          Ross Boylan for making the suggestion, Sam Steingold for
          reminding us of this variable and Martin Maechler for the
          warning.

   * ESS now uses `IDO' completing read functionality for all the
     interactive requests. It uses ido completion mechanism whenever
     available, and falls back on classical completing-read otherwise.
     You can set `ess-use-ido' to nil if you don't want the IDO
     completion. See the documentation string of `ess-use-ido' for more
     information about `IDO' and ESS configuration.

   * ESS[S]: "`,'" is bound to ess-smart-comma: If comma is invoked at
     the process marker of an ESS inferior buffer, request and execute
     a command from ``ess-handy-commands'' list. If
     `ess-R-smart-operators' is t ``ess-smart-comma' also inserts " "
     after comma.

   * ESS[S], notably `R': Variable ``ess-handy-commands'' stores an
     alist of useful commands which are called by `ess-smart-comma' in
     the inferior buffer.

     Currently containing:

    change-directory
          `ess-change-directory'

    help-index
          `ess-display-index'

    help-object
          `ess-display-help-on-object'

    vignettes
          `ess-display-vignettes'

    objects[ls]
          `ess-execute-objects'

    search
          `ess-execute-search'

    set-width
          `ess-execute-screen-options'

    install.packages
          `ess-install.packages'

    library
          `ess-library'

    setRepos
          `ess-setRepositories'

    sos
          `ess-sos'

     Handy commands: `ess-library', `ess-install.packages', etc - ask
     for item with completion and execute the correspond command.
     `ess-sos' is a interface to `findFn' function in package `sos'. If
     package `sos' is not found, ask user for interactive install.

   * ESS: New dynamic mode line indicator: Process status is
     automatically reflected in all mode-lines of associated with the
     process buffers. Particularly useful for displaying debug status of
     `ess-tracebug' and developer status of `ess-developer' in all
     associated buffers.

   * ESS: New `ess-completing-read' mechanism: ESS uses `ido'
     completions whenever possible. Variable `ess-use-ido' controls
     whether to use ido completion or not. Active by default.

   * ESS now supports comint fields for output and input detection.
     This feature is not used by default, but might be useful in the
     future.

   * ESS[S]: New custom variable `inferior-ess-S-prompt' to customize
     prompt detection regular expression in the inferior ESS buffers.
     You can customize this variable to enhance comint navigation
     (`comint-previous-prompt' and `comint-next-prompt') the inferior
     buffers.

   * ESS[R]: Internal `R' completion retrieval
     (`ess-R-complete-object-name')  was rewritten and is faster now.

   * ESS is using process plist to store process specific variables, as
     opposed to buffer local variables as it was using before. The use
     of buffer local variables to store process variables is
     discouraged.

   * ESS: new functions to manipulate process plists: `ess-process-get'
     and `ess-process-set'.

   * ESS: Internal process waiting mechanism was completely rewritten.
     ESS no more relies on prompt regular expressions for the prompt
     detection. The only requirement on the primary process prompt is
     to end in `> '. This could be overwritten by setting
     `inferor-ess-primary-prompt'.

   * ESS[S], notably `R': Saved command history:  ESS-HISTORY-FILE now
     accepts `t' (default), `nil', or a  file name. By setting it to
     `nil' no command line history is saved  anymore.
     ESS-HISTORY-DIRECTORY now allows to have the history  all saved in
     one "central" file.

   * ESS[R]: more Roxygen improvements.

   * ESS[R]: `C-c .' to set (indentation) style.

   * ESS[R]: Functions with non-standard names (for example
     'aaa-bbb:cc') are properly handled by font-lock and evaluation
     routines.

   * ESS[R]:Several regexp bugs (described in etc/R-ESS-bugs.el) were
     fixed in `ess-get-words-from-vector' and `ess-command'.

   Changes/New Features in 5.14:
   * ESS[BUGS/JAGS]:  Batch BUGS is back!  For recent OpenBUGS
     versions, 3.0.8+, a batch BUGS script is once again available, but
     for Linux only.  Therefore, since it seems that BUGS and JAGS must
     co-exist (rather than a transition from BUGS to JAGS), .bug files
     are now in ESS[BUGS] mode and .jag files are in ESS[JAGS] mode.
     ESS[BUGS] now works like ESS[JAGS] rather than the original mode
     ESS[BUGS] mode which was difficult to maintain.  Although,
     ESS[BUGS] appears to work, there still may be some features
     missing as well as bugs.

   * ESS[R]: New customizable variable `ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p'
     Commands to Sweave current file and LaTeX the result are now
     available to AUCTeX users, if this variable is set to `t'.

   * ESS[S]: `C-c C-c' (`ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step') is
     now skipping over comments as the other paragraph functions do.
     It (and similar functions) should no longer wrongly find
     `function()' beginnings inside comments or strings.

   * ESS[SAS]: improved by better support for GNU Emacs

   Changes/New Features in 5.13:
   * ESS[R]: On Windows, for R 2.12.0 and later, the Rterm executables
     (in subdirectories i386 / x64) now are found as well as for
     earlier R versions.

   * ESS[S+]: on Windows, both 32- and 64-bit versions of S+ ("S-PLUS")
     are found now and made available on the menu.

   * ESS[R]: When prompting for a starting directory, the R version is
     (always?) correct now.

   * ESS[R]: on non-Windows platforms, the `use-dialog-box'  variable
     is no longer temporarily changed (to `nil' for R-x.y.z version
     functions and to `t' for `R' itself), but rather the user
     customization is obeyed.

   * ESS[R]: more Roxygen improvements.

   * `Rd-preview-help' now generates preview buffers with navigation
     facilities the same as regular help buffers.

   * ESS: New functions and keys C-c [up] / [down]  for evaluating the
     buffer "from beginning till here".

   Changes/New Features in 5.12:
   * ESS[SAS] Font-locking:  update of PROCs keywords (up to SAS 9.22);
     error/warnings.

   * ESS[R]: Roxygen improvements: S4 classes;  also optionally keep
     spaces when filling arguments

   * ESS[Rd]: support new keywords:  section-name \subsection plus a
     dozen "new" keywords; should match R  2.12.x now.

   * `ess-display-help-on-object' (`C-c C-v')  now _caches_ the list of
     topics, thus speeding up the improvement  feature introduced in
     5.9.

   Changes/New Features in 5.11:
   * Filename completion within buffers now adds only trailing
     characters to complete the filename, rather than expanding to an
     absolute file path.  This filename completion is bound to the TAB
     key.

   * `M-n P' in Sweave buffers now prompts for the command to run
     instead of using `pdflatex' unconditionally, offering completion
     from customizable collection `ess-swv-pdflatex-commands', the
     first of which is taken as default and that defaults to `texi2pdf'.

   * `M-RET' is now also bound in S language (R and S+) buffers to
     `ess-use-this-dir'. It sends `setwd(..)' to the S process to set
     the working directory to the one of the source file.

   Changes/New Features in 5.10:
   * `M-RET' in *S* buffers is now bound to `ess-dirs'.  This function
     will set Emacs's current directory to be the same as the *S*
     process.  This is useful if you use `setwd()' within a *S* process.

   Changes/New Features in 5.9:
   * Toolbar:  The toolbar now has an icon for starting Splus.

   * Indentation: New documentation and code has been added to make it
     easier to change how ESS indents code.  In particular, see
     `ess-default-style', `ess-own-style-list' and the documention
     subsection "Changing indentation styles".

   * `ess-display-help-on-object' (`C-c C-v') now offers  completion
     candidates for help file aliases, in addition to object  names.

   * Font locking: is now turned on  even without `window-system' is
     `nil', whenever  ESS-FONT-LOCK-MODE is non-nil, i.e., by default.

   * ESS script editing: ess-eval-deactivate-mark default is now t,  as
     suggested by Leo Alekseyev and subsequent "unanimous" ESS-help
     discussion.

   * ESS[R]: Editing support for "#!" (Rscript / littler) editing,
     thanks to Jeffrey Arnold.

   * ESS[R]: Now finds all R versions, both 64-bit and 32-bit, on some
     64-bit Windows machines.  Please report back to ess-core success
     or failure  on your 64-bit Windows machine.

   * ESS Manual now more visually pleasing;
     `http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html'

   * ESS[R]: Roxygen on XEmacs no longer font locks for now  (as it
     required missing features and hence broke ESS startup, there).

   * ESS[R]: Roxygen has a sub-menu on the [ESS] menu.

   * ESS[R]: Function `ess-rutils-htmldocs' in  `ess-rutils.el' offers
     an alternative to `help.start()' for  navigating R documentation,
     using the `browse-url' Emacs  function.

   Changes/New Features in 5.8:
   * ESS[R]: New `ess-rutils.el' with utilities for listing, loading,
     installing, and updating packages, as well as object manipulation
     (listing, viewing, and deleting).  It also provides an alternative
     to `RSiteSearch()' that uses the `browse-url' function, so results
     can be viewed in an Emacs web browser.

   * ESS[R]: much more extensive Roxygen interface, via ess-roxy.el
     from Henning Redestig. Ess-roxy supports filling of roxygen fields,
     generation and updating roxygen templates, completion of roxygen
     tags,  basic navigation (marking and moving between entries),
     folding using  hs-minor-mode and preview of the Rd file.

   * Emacs lisp files have got better names (partly, for now).

   Changes/New Features in 5.7:
   * ESS[R]: loading a source file (`C-c C-l') now works in  Windows,
     similarly to other platforms;  (further; it had accidentally been
     broken in ESS 5.6 on all platforms)

   Changes/New Features in 5.6:
   * ESS[R]: help() calls have to differ from old default, with newer
     versions of R; currently via .help.ESS <- function(...) hack.

   Changes/New Features in 5.4:
   * ESS[SAS]: The long overdue change from `make-regexp' to
     `regexp-opt' for font-locking is complete.  The new `regexp-opt'
     is now the default since it is better than the old code in many
     ways (and especially more maintainable).  However, there are
     certainly some special cases missed (bug reports and patches
     welcome!).  Setting `ess-sas-run-regexp-opt' to `nil' will result
     in the old code being used.

   * ESS[BUGS] and ESS[JAGS]: typing `=' now results in  `<-'.

   * ESS[R] function arguments "show" `(ess-r-args-show)' now  uses the
     new `(tooltip-show-at-point)' contributed by Erik Iverson.

   * Toolbar icons now also work in (beta) Emacs 23.

   * ESS[S]: New function `ess-change-directory' for setting both
     emacs' current directory and the directory of an *R* or *S* buffer.

   * ESS[S] when transient-mark-mode is true, the mark is now kept,
     rather than deactivated, thanks to a patch from David Reitter.

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.11:
   * ESS[SAS]: work around bug in Emacs 22.2 & 22.3 which fails to  set
     case-fold fontification automatically.

   * Rd mode: support new keyword 'Rdversion'

   * ESS[R]: now again works with Emacs 21.x

   Changes/New Features in 5.3.10:
   * Fixed noweb-mode bug accidentally introduced into 5.3.9

   * In noweb-mode, e.g., Rnw-mode, electric "<" also inserts closing
     "@".   Further, the code chunk boundaries are better kept
     up-to-date, such that  code[R] <-> text[LaTeX] minor mode
     switching should happen more reliably.

   * In noweb-mode, fix a buglet in rare [Enter] or [Tab] behavior;
     further,  by default disable the former `[[' .. `]]'
     code-protection-when-filling  behavior which has been found to be
     buggy.
